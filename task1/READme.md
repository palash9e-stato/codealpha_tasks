This project focuses on building a Credit Scoring Model to predict an individual’s creditworthiness using historical financial data. Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are applied to make loan approval decisions. The workflow includes feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC. The dataset contains key financial attributes like income, debts, payment behavior, and credit history to support reliable, data-driven predictions.
