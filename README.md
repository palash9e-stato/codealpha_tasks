## Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

This project focuses on predicting an individual’s creditworthiness using historical financial data such as income, debts, and payment behavior. Various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were implemented. Feature engineering techniques were applied to improve model performance. The models were evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliable credit risk assessment.

## Task 3: Handwritten Character Recognition

This project aims to recognize handwritten digits and characters using deep learning techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained on the MNIST and EMNIST datasets after image preprocessing and normalization. The model learns spatial features to accurately classify characters. The project can be extended to word or sentence recognition using sequence-based models such as CRNN.

## Task 4: Disease Prediction from Medical Data

This project predicts the likelihood of diseases based on structured medical data including age, symptoms, and clinical test results. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost were explored. The model performance was evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. Public datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository were used to ensure real-world relevance.
